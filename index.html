        Hello hello, my name’s Staas! I initially got into coding because I wanted to do game and website design. I graduated from high school in 2017 about 6 months early to work full-time and have been working since! My first job was at a restaurant, and I worked there for about 2 years. I then started working at an arcade called Wunderland and stayed there for about 5 years. That job sparked my interest in coding because I had to actively fix the games daily.

        After leaving, I worked at a warehouse called Gopuff for nearly 2 years until my position was eliminated. I later returned because I genuinely enjoy the work. In my opinion, staying with a company for 2 years is the minimum to show I’ve tried my best to advance but not so long that I feel like I’m wasting time. After finishing my coding certification, I plan to study at "Phagins School of Hair and Design" to get a cosmetology license. I may not pursue a career in beauty, but it’s an opportunity I don't want to waste!
