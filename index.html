      <h1> A little about me!</h1>
      <p> Hello hello my names Staas I initally got into coding cause I really wanted to do game and website design! I graduated from high school in 2017 about 6 months early to be able to work full time and have been working sense! My first job was at a restaurent and I worked there for about 2 years, while working that I started to work at an arcade called Wunderland and I stayed there for about 5 year's! That job initally peaked my interest to code becasue I had to activly fix them daily. After leaving that I then started working in a warehouse called Gopuff and stayed there for nearly 2 years until i was laid off due to my position being taken away but then ended up going back cause I genuinally enjoy the work there. In my opinion staying with a company for 2 years is a bare minimum as its long enough to know ive tried my absolute best to move up but not so long that I feel as though im wasteing mine and my employers time. Moving back to education once I finish schooling here and get my certifaction for this i will start school at "Phagins School Of Hair And Design" and get my licenses to be a licensed consomotologist, Though I do not want to persue anything related to the beauty indistry I know that I have the oppertinity to go there for free and learn so itd be an oppertunity waisted!</p>
